    <h2>About the Project</h2>
    <p>
      This project is a refactor of
      <a href="https://github.com/jycl1234/fgo-lookup" target="_blank">FGO Lookup</a>, which is a
      tool I wrote in 2020 as part of a take-home assignment for a coding interview. At the time, I
      had only some basic experience working with React, and was completely unfamiliar with Vue. The
      scope of the project involved learning how to use Vue, Vue Router for hash URLs, and the
      Google Sheets API to fetch data for the frontend. Since the position was intended to be
      frontend-leaning, I decided to forgo the database setup and instead opted for a hardcoded JSON
      file that would serve as the "database".
    </p>
    <p>
      Four years later, I have learned and worked on many more projects that have greatly increased
      my experience and exposure to both React and Vue, and I am once again working on a take-home
      assignment for a coding interview. I figured that this would be a good time to brush up on Vue
      in preparation for the role, as well as revisit all of the decisions I made during the course
      of the original project to see what I would do differently now.
